    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be\n",
    "integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",

    "    varible:The Varible is defined as something which hold a values and the assigned values can be changed by the user.\n",

    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "   (1) Numeric data types: This data type is used to hold numerical values like\n",
    "   eg:int - holds signed integers of non-limited length.\n",
    "      float- holds floating precision numbers and itâ€™s accurate up to 15 decimal places.\n",
    "      complex- holds complex numbers.\n",
    "        \n",
    "   (2) String Data Type: This data type is used to store sequence or a list of character in order and the characters should be \n",
    "    always be enclosed in single or double quotes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   (3) Boolean data type: It is one of the built in data types which represent one of two types which is either true or false.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do? \n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value.\n",
    "    it mainly used for the representation of values it .String can be also considered as expression as it represent a value.\n",
    "    \n",

    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "Solution:egg is considered as string and 100 is a integer. in python only string can be used as a varible ans integer cannot\n",
    "    be assigned as a varible.\n",
    "      \n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string\n",
    "version of a value?        \n",
    "Solution:int(), float(), and str() functions will evaluate to the integer, floating-point number, and string \n",
    "        \n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?       \n",
    "'i have eaten'+99+'burritos'\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:an only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str.\n",
    "    it can be corrected by placing 99 in single quotes\n",
    "    \n",
